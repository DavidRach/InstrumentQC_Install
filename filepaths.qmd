In the previous sections, we installed the required software, and set up the Git permissions needed for Rstudio and our GitHub repository to communicate with each other and pass the updated versions of the files between. This next segment focuses on individual local computers, first in getting the R packages needed for data processing and handling installed, and then setting the file paths up so that R knows in which folders to look for your Daily QC report .csv and fcs files. 

# R Packages

The next steps are to install required R packages needed to execute the code. Most of these are available through either Bioconductor or CRAN repositories. The one exception is our R package Luciernaga that host some of the dashboard functions, that is currently only available via GitHub. To install, follow the following workflow.

# Setting up Locally

Within the InstrumentQC data, there is a data folder with individual archive folders for each instrument. Modify the names accordingly for your own setting. Within the archived folder, delete the existing files that contain our institutions data.

Next, you will need to modify the existing Rscript to match the following names, and to point at the Cytekbio Setup folder containing the DailyQC files and to the folder containing the bead .fcs files used as part of the MFI monitoring. Make sure these are correct.

Now, on the upper right hand side, hit the Source option. This should trigger the processing of the entire R script needed to process the past data. If it fails, you will need to troubleshoot whether the file.path your provided is the correct one (most likely error) or an R package dependency is missing (in which case it would need to be installed).

Once complete, you should see the processed data is now present within the Archive folder.

Open up the equivalent .qmd file for your given instrument. This file is what will build the dashboard for the equivalent instrument page on the website. Make sure to similarly modify the file.paths at the top of the file so they match your Archive folder for that project. Once done, hit render button and wait, troubleshooting as needed. Both R script and .qmd will be specific and search for the data within those folders, so we anticipate less issues.

Once done, either a browser window will open showing the data for the instrument, or you will need to go to InstrumentQC, docs folder and open the index.html file to see a local rendered version of the file. Once you are here, congratulations, the basic install for your instrument has been carried out successfully. Repeat for the other instruments for the time being.
