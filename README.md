# InstrumentQC 

Having reached this webpage, you have likely discovered the [InstrumentQC dashboard](https://umgccfcss.github.io/InstrumentQC/) I implemented at the University of Maryland, Baltimore for our four Cytek Aurora instruments. This website is for those who would like to understand how it is implemented, either for curiosity or because you'd like to modify the code to visualize the instrument QC data for your own Cytek instruments at your current workplace.  

Having placed significant effort into this pet-project, I would love for others in the cytometry community to benefit from it. Setting it up from scratch requires some familiarity with both R and Git, so to give the average cytometry aficionado a fighting-chance I am providing this detailed explanation of the process of setting up and customizing the dashboard.

If you get stuck, or parts of the documentation are unclear, please reach out by opening an [issue](https://github.com/DavidRach/InstrumentQC_Install/issues) and I will try my best to help you troubleshoot. What makes free-and-open source software great (and fun to work with in my opinion) is seeing how the collective small contributions of users improve the project over time. 

Best-

David
