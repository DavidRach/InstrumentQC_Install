Due to the age-related decline of the immune system, infectious diseases remain among the top 5-10 causes of mortality and morbidity in the elderly, and improving immune function during aging remains an important aspect of healthspan extension. Calorie restriction (CR) and more recently rapamycin (rapa) feeding have both been used to extend lifespan in mice. Preciously few studies have actually investigated the impact of each of these interventions upon in vivo immune defense against relevant microbial challenge in old organisms. We tested how rapa and CR each impacted the immune system in adult and old mice. We report that each intervention differentially altered T-cell development in the thymus, peripheral T-cell maintenance, T-cell function and host survival after West Nile virus infection, inducing distinct but deleterious consequences to the aging immune system. We conclude that neither rapa feeding nor CR, in the current form/administration regimen, may be optimal strategies for extending healthy immune function and, with it, lifespan.			1.5	SDY654	Immunological basis of age-related vulnerability in biodefense and emerging infections SP2 UAz	Janko Nikolich-Zugich: University of Arizona;Emily Goldberg: University of Arizona	Mus musculus	DR15	Aging	N		Months	ELISA;Q-PCR;Flow Cytometry	0.33	10.21430/M33E7TCYXT

The dysfunctions of adaptive B and T cells are well documented but the effect of aging on innate immunity remains incompletely understood. Using a heterogeneous population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we first undertook transcriptional profiling and found that PBMCs isolated from old individuals (>= 65 yrs) exhibited a delayed and altered response to stimulation with TLR4, TLR7/8, and RIG-I agonists compared to cells obtained from adults (<= 40 yrs). This delayed response to innate immune agonists resulted in the reduced production of pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines and chemokines including TNFa, IL-6, IL-1b, IFNg, IFNa, CCL2 and CCL7. While the major monocyte and dendritic cell subsets did not change numerically with aging, activation of specific cell types was altered. PBMCs from old subjects also had a lower frequency of CD40+ monocytes, impaired up-regulation of PD-L1 on monocytes and T cells and increased expression of PD-L2 and B7-H4 on B cells. The defective immune response to innate agonists adversely affected adaptive immunity as TLR-stimulated PBMCs (minus CD3 T cells) from old subjects elicited significantly lower levels of adult T cell proliferation than those from adult subjects in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Collectively, these age-associated changes in cytokine, chemokine and interferon production, as well as co-stimulatory protein expression could contribute to the blunted memory B and T cell immune responses to vaccines and infections.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma has been implicated in the prevention of inflammation in autoimmune and infectious diseases; however, its role in the immunoregulatory mechanisms modulating host responses to C. difficile remains largely unknown. To characterize the role of PPAR gamma in C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD), immunity and gut pathology, we used a mouse model of C. difficile infection in wild-type and T cell-specific PPAR gamma null mice. The loss of PPAR gamma in T cells increased disease activity and colonic inflammatory lesions following C. difficile infection. Colonic expression of IL-17 was upregulated and IL-10 downregulated in colons of T cell-specific PPAR gamma null mice. Also, both the loss of PPAR gamma in T cells and C. difficile infection favored Th17 responses in spleen and colonic lamina propria of mice with CDAD. MicroRNA (miRNA)-sequencing analysis and RT-PCR validation indicated that miR-146b was significantly overexpressed in colons of C. difficile-infected mice. We next developed a computational model that predicts the upregulation of miR-146b, downregulation of the PPAR gamma co-activator NCOA4, and PPAR gamma, leading to upregulation of IL-17. Treatment of C. difficile-infected mice with the PPAR gamma agonist pioglitazone ameliorated colitis and suppressed pro-inflammatory gene expression. In conclusion, our data indicates that miRNA-146b and PPAR gamma may be implicated in the regulation of Th17 responses and colitis in C. difficile-infected mice.

In autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D), adoptive transfer of autologous polyclonal Tregs has been shown to be safe in adults in Phase I clinical trials. We explored factors contributing to efficacy of autologous polyclonal expanded Tregs (expTregs) in a randomized Phase II multi-center, double-blind, clinical trial in 110 treated children and adolescents with new-onset T1D (Sanford/Lisata Therapeutics T-Rex Phase II trial) randomized 1:1:1 to high- (24*10^6 cells/kg) or low- (1*10^6 cells/kg) dose treatments or to matching placebo. Cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing were performed on selected expTregs and peripheral blood samples from participants. The single doses of expTregs were safe but did not prevent the decline in residual beta cell function over one year compared to placebo (P = 0.94 low dose, P = 0.21 high dose), regardless of age or baseline C-peptide. ExpTregs were highly activated and suppressive in vitro. A transient increase of activated memory Tregs was detectable one week after infusion in the high dose cohort suggesting effective transfer of expTregs. However, in vitro fold expansion of expTregs varied across participants even when accounting for age and lower fold expansion and its associated gene signature were linked with better C-peptide preservation regardless of Treg dose. These results suggest that a single dose of polyclonal expTregs does not alter progression in T1D; instead, Treg quality may be an important factor.

Protein vaccinations generally elicit CD4 T cell responses that are skewed toward a small fraction of epitopes, a phenomenon known as immunodominance. This characteristic of T cell responses, that limits the diversity of CD4 T cell recognition, is generally attributed to intracellular antigen processing. However, we recently discovered that immunodominance hierarchies persist even after vaccination with synthetic peptides. In this study, we probed the regulatory mechanisms that cause diminished CD4 T cell responses to subdominant peptides after such multi-peptide immunization in mice. We have found that the delivery of subdominant and dominant epitopes on separate dendritic cells rescues expansion of less favored CD4 T cells. Furthermore, through the use of genetic models and inhibitors, we have found that selective losses in CD4 T cell responses are mediated by an IFN-gamma-induced pathway, involving indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and that regulatory T cell (Treg) activities may also regulate preferences in CD4 T cell specificity. We propose that after multi-peptide immunization, the expansion and differentiation of dominant T cells initiate complex regulatory events that determine the final peptide specificity of the elicited CD4 T cell response.

SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD4+ T cells have been reported in unexposed individuals, suggesting pre-existing cross-reactive T cell memory in 20-50% of people. However, the source of those T cells has been speculative. Using human blood samples derived before the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered in 2019, we demonstrate a range of pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells that are cross-reactive with comparable affinity to SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, or HCoV-HKU1. Thus, variegated T cell memory to coronaviruses that cause the common cold may underlie at least some of the extensive heterogeneity observed in COVID-19 disease.

The relative contributions of T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) subsets to gastritis and control of infection are still under investigation. Expression of IL-21, which may be produced by a number of T cell subsets, has been reported to increase during H. pylori infection. To investigate the role of IL-21 in the gastric mucosa during H. pylori infection, we combined mathematical modeling of CD4+ T cell differentiation with in vivo studies to elucidate the impact of IL-21 on H. pylori infection. Our computational modeling efforts predict that IL-21 activates the production of IFN gamma and IL17, the expression of Tbet and RORgamma t, the phosphorylation of STAT3, and suggest a potential role of IL-21 in the modulation of IL-10. To elucidate the role IL-21 in vivo, we infected IL-21 deficient mice and wild-type littermates with H. pylori strain SS1, and assessed colonization, gastric inflammation, cellular infiltration, and cytokine profiles in the gastric tissue.

Despite intense interest in understanding both the generation and effector functions of this lineage, little is known about the epitope specificity of Tfh cells generated during polyclonal responses. To date, studies of peptide-specific Tfh cells have relied on either the transfer of TcR transgenic cells or use of peptide:MHC class II tetramers and antibodies to stain TcR and follow limited peptide specificities. In order to comprehensively evaluate polyclonal responses generated from the natural endogenous TcR repertoire, we developed a sorting strategy to separate Tfh cells from non-Tfh cells and found that their epitope-specific responses could be tracked with cytokine-specific ELISPOT assays. The immunodominance hierarchies of Tfh and non-Tfh cells generated in response to immunization with several unrelated protein antigens were remarkably similar. Additionally, increasing the kinetic stability of peptide-MHC class II complexes enhanced the priming of both Tfh and conventional CD4 T cells. These findings may provide us with a strategy to rationally and selectively modulate epitope-specific Tfh responses. By understanding the parameters that control epitope-specific priming, vaccines may be tailored to enhance or focus Tfh responses to facilitate optimal B cell responses.

In particular, lymphoid tissues, which are the sites of the evolving response, have been understudied due to logistical and ethical issues. Thus, most prior work on vaccine correlates of protection have been unable to identify the mechanisms involved in potentiating vaccine responses. To address this gap, in this study we used an immune organoid model to identify novel correlates and predictors of the human influenza response.

While extensive efforts have focused on potentiating cell-mediated immunity to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, less effort has been invested in exploiting the humoral immune system to combat Mtb. Emerging data point to a role for antibodies in microbial control of Mtb, however the precise mechanism(s) of this control remain incompletely understood. Here we took an antibody Fc-engineering approach to determine whether Fc-modifications could improve the ability of antibodies to restrict Mtb, and to define Fc-mediated mechanism(s) antibodies leverage for this restriction. Using an antibody specific to the capsular polysaccharide α-glucan, we engineered a panel of Fc variants to augment or dampen select antibody effector functions, rationally building antibodies with enhanced capacity to promote Mtb restriction in a human whole blood model of infection. Surprisingly, several restrictive Fc-engineered antibodies drove Mtb control in a neutrophil, not monocyte, dependent manner. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we show that an Fc-engineered antibody with restrictive activity promotes neutrophil survival and expression of cell intrinsic antimicrobial programs. These data provide a roadmap for exploiting Fc-engineered antibodies as a novel class of TB therapeutics able to harness the protective functions of neutrophils to achieve disease control.

Virus-derived epitopes were derived from CMV, EBV, VZV, HAdV-C, B19, HIV-1 and VACV along with one MART-1 tumor specifity. Each file is named according to the specific donor, epitope sequence and HLA-restriction used. Each tetramer-specificity was encoded as a combination of 1-2 fluorochromes; a list of combinations is present as a metadata file along with information of percieved reactivity to cognate peptide stimulation in a previous assay (see Pagh Kristensen et al 2023 BioRvix, https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.06.565606). This study also performed downsampling and computational analysis of virus-specific populations compared to bulk CD8 T cells from each donor. Maximum 5000 cells were exported from each population including bulk CD8 T cells and used as input for FlowSOM clustering and umap dimentionality reduction, 8 clusters were chosen to represent different phenptypic groups within the dataset.

However, the changes that occur in the lung cellular milieu post-primary Mtb infection and their contributions to protection upon reinfection remain poorly understood. Here, using clinical and microbiological endpoints in a non-human primate reinfection model, we demonstrate that prior Mtb infection elicits a long-lasting protective response against subsequent Mtb exposure and that the depletion of CD4-positive T cells prior to Mtb rechallenge significantly abrogates this protection. Leveraging microbiologic, PET-CT, flow cytometric, and single-cell RNA-seq data from primary infection, reinfection, and reinfection-CD4-positive T cell depleted granulomas, we identify differential cellular and microbial features of control. The data collectively demonstrate that the presence of CD4-positive T cells in the setting of reinfection results in a reduced inflammatory lung milieu characterized by reprogrammed CD8-positive T cell activity, reduced neutrophilia, and blunted type-1 immune signaling among myeloid cells, mitigating Mtb disease severity. These results open avenues for developing vaccines and therapeutics that not only target CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells, but also modulate innate immune cells to limit Mtb disease.

We discovered widespread dynamic allele-specific expression across the genome, where the balance of alleles changes over time, in 356 SNPs spanning 186 genes. These genes were four fold enriched in autoimmune loci. We found pervasive dynamic regulatory effects within six HLA genes, particularly for a major autoimmune risk gene, HLA-DQB1.

This model recapitulates innate and adaptive human immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection up to 28 days after infection, with key features of chronic COVID-19, including weight loss, persistent viral RNA, lung pathology with fibrosis, a human inflammatory macrophage response, a persistent interferon-stimulated gene signature and T cell lymphopenia. We used this model to study two therapeutics on immunopathology, patient-derived antibodies and steroids and found that the same inflammatory macrophages crucial to containing early infection later drove immunopathology. This model will enable evaluation of COVID-19 disease mechanisms and treatments.			89.0	SDY1945	Immuno-Serological Assays for Monitoring COVID19 in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies	Richard Flavell: Yale University;Stephanie Halene: Yale		DR44	COVID-19	N		Years	RNA sequencing;ELISA;Flow Cytometry;PCR;Virus Plaque Assay	0.0	10.21430/M3S6CCM01K

Memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes that crossrecognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2–specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.			72.0	SDY1815	Johns Hopkins Excellence in Pathogenesis and Immunity Center for SARS-CoV-2 (JH-EPICS)	Andrea Cox: Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy		DR44	COVID-19	N		Years	PCR;Flow Cytometry	21.0	10.21430/M3C1CZ1MF2

While these ‘resisters’ (RSTR) display IFN-γ-independent T cell responses to the M.tb-specific antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10, it is currently unknown whether unique T cell functional programs are associated with this clinical outcome. We used multi-modal single-cell RNA, TCR sequencing, multi-parameter flow cytometry, and cytokine analysis in a discovery and validation format to compare the phenotypes and functions of M.tb-specific T cells between RSTRs and matched controls with ‘latent’ M.tb infection (LTBI). M.tb-specific T cells were clonally expanded in both RSTRs and LTBIs, confirming the priming of adaptive immune responses after M.tb exposure. However, M.tb-specific T cells derived from RSTRs showed enrichment of T regulatory as well as Th17-like functional programs compared to LTBIs, which were characterized by Th1*-like effector programs. Th17-like functional programs were also associated with a lack of progression to active TB among South African adolescents with LTBI, as well as bacterial control in published non-human primate studies. Together, these data suggest that ‘resisters’ may successfully control M.tb after exposure and immune priming and establish a set of T cell biomarkers to facilitate further study of this important clinical phenotype.

CVB3 infection also exhibits a strong sex bias, with males showing increased susceptibility to disease, which is incompletely understood. Despite these burdens, there are no vaccines or treatments available for Coxsackievirus infections. Using an oral inoculation mouse model to recapitulate natural infection, we demonstrated a sex bias where male mice succumb to CVB3-induced disease at an increased rate than female mice, consistent with human infections. Here we make the novel observation that CVB3 induces the expansion of antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells in female mice but not in male mice. The CD8+ T cells in female mice have an activated phenotype following infection, and we demonstrate that these T cells protect female mice from CVB3-induced mortality. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of evaluating sex differences in the immune response to viral pathogens and may have implications for future T cell vaccine strategies.

How the ability of the CD4+ T-cell compartment to bind self- and foreign-pMHC changes over the lifespan remains a fundamental aspect of T-cell biology that is largely unexplored. We report that, while old mice (18-22 months) contain fewer CD4+ T-cells compared with adults (8-12 weeks), those that remain have a higher intrinsic affinity for self-pMHC, as measured by CD5 expression. Old mice also have more cells that bind individual or multiple distinct foreign-pMHCs, and the fold increase in pMHC-binding populations is directly related to their CD5 levels. These data demonstrate that the CD4+ T-cell compartment preferentially accumulates promiscuous constituents with age as a consequence of higher affinity T-cell receptor interactions with self-pMHC.			1.83	SDY663	Immunological basis of age-related vulnerability in biodefense and emerging infections SP2 UAz	Michael Kuhns: University of Arizona;Neha Deshpande: University of Arizona	Mus musculus	DR15	Aging	N		Months	Flow Cytometry	0.33	10.21430/M3SR2T3WZF

To gain insight into how vaccines induce protection of the most vulnerable, our project employs two novel approaches studying newborn responses to hepatitis B vaccine (HBV): (a) systems biology that uses technologies which comprehensively measure global changes in molecules such as transcriptomics (RNA) and proteomics (proteins), as well as cell composition of the blood and (b) use of human newborn blood components, collected prior to immunization, to model vaccine responses in vitro (outside the body). Characterizing vaccine-induced molecular patterns (signatures) that correspond to vaccine-mediated protection will accelerate development and optimization of vaccines against early life infections of major global health importance.

Less is known about radiosensitivity of memory cell subsets. We examined the radiosensitivity of naive (TN), effector memory (TEM), and central memory (TCM) T cell subsets in C57BL/6 mice and found TEM to be more resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis than either TN or TCM. Surprisingly, we found no correlation between the extent of radiation-induced apoptosis in T cell subsets and 1) levels of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members or 2) the H2AX content and maximal gamma H2AX fold change. Rather, TEM cell survival correlated with higher levels of immediate gamma H2AX marking, immediate break binding and genome-wide open chromatin structure. T cells were able to mark DNA damage seemingly instantly (30 s), even if kept on ice. Relaxing chromatin with the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid following radiation or etoposide treatment improved the survival of TCM and TN cells up to levels seen in the resistant TEM cells but did not improve survival from caspase-mediated apoptosis. We conclude that an open genome-wide chromatin state is the key determinant of efficient immediate repair of DNA damage in T cells, explaining the observed T cell subset radiosensitivity differences.			0.67	SDY656	Immunological basis of age-related vulnerability in biodefense and emerging infections SP2 UAz	Janko Nikolich-Zugich: University of Arizona;Jason Pugh: University of Arizona	Mus musculus	DR15		N		Months	Other;Flow Cytometry;Microscopy	0.67	10.21430/M3RLFCF61C

We and others have recently shown that unimmunized old mice lose ? 70% of Ag-specific CD8 T cell precursors and that many of the remaining precursors acquire a virtual (central) memory (VM; CD44(hi)CD62L(hi)) phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that unimmunized TCR transgenic (TCRTg) mice also undergo massive VM conversion with age, exhibiting rapid effector function upon both TCR and cytokine triggering. Age-related VM conversion in TCRTg mice directly depended on replacement of the original TCRTg specificity by endogenous TCR? rearrangements, indicating that TCR signals must be critical in VM conversion. Importantly, we found that VM conversion had adverse functional effects in both old wild-type and old TCRTg mice; that is, old VM, but not old true naive, T cells exhibited blunted TCR-mediated, but not IL-15-mediated, proliferation. This selective proliferative senescence correlated with increased apoptosis in old VM cells in response to peptide, but decreased apoptosis in response to homeostatic cytokines IL-7 and IL-15. Our results identify TCR as the key factor in differential maintenance and function of Ag-specific precursors in unimmunized mice with aging, and they demonstrate that two separate age-related defects--drastic reduction in true naive T cell precursors and impaired proliferative capacity of their VM cousins--combine to reduce naive T cell responses with aging.			0.17	SDY649	Immunological basis of age-related vulnerability in biodefense and emerging infections SP2 UAz	Janko Nikolich-Zugich: University of Arizona;Kristin Renkema: University of Arizona;Megan Smithey: University of Arizona;Gang Li: University of Arizona	Mus musculus	DR15	Aging	N		Months	Q-PCR;Flow Cytometry	0.17	10.21430/M337H2FFFJ

On eosinophils that have been primed with IL-5, GM-CSF, or IL-33, antibody ligation of Siglec-8 leads to cell death through a pathway involving the β2 integrin-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NADPH oxidase. In contrast, engagement of Siglec-8 on mast cells has been described to inhibit mast cell activation and mediator release but not impact cell viability. The differences in responses between cytokine-primed and unprimed eosinophils, and between eosinophils and mast cells, to Siglec-8 ligation are not understood. In addition, we have previously found that Siglec-8 binds to sialylated ligands on the surface of the same cell (so-called cis ligands) on eosinophils, preventing interaction with a Siglec-8 ligand in trans. However, the functional relevance of these cis ligands have not been elucidated. We therefore explored the potential influence of cis ligands of Siglec-8 on the surfaces of both eosinophils and mast cells. Removal of sialic acid using exogenous sialidase had profound effects on the consequences of Siglec-8 antibody engagement on both cell types, eliminating the need for cytokine priming of eosinophils to facilitate cell death and enabling Siglec-8-dependent mast cell death without impacting anti-Siglec-8 antibody binding. The cell death process licensed by incubation with sialidase resembled that characterized in IL-5-primed eosinophils, including the upregulation of CD11b, production of ROS, and requirement for the signaling activities of Syk, PI3K, and PLC. These results implicate cis ligands in restraining Siglec-8 function on eosinophils and mast cells and reveal a promising approach to the selective depletion of mast cells in patients with mast cell-mediated diseases.

The p40 subunit of both interleukins binds to the transmembrane IL-12 receptor-beta1 (IL-12R ) on the surface of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody, anti-IL12p40, which binds to the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 with high affinity and specificity, inhibiting the activity of both interleukins. Ustekinumab has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, with up to 76% of patients achieving a 75% reduction in their psoriasis area and severity index (PASI-75).1, It is routinely recommended that psoriasis patients treated with biologic therapies such as ustekinumab be vaccinated annually with the influenza vaccine. We can thus assess the importance of these cytokines in the immune response to vaccination by comparing the immune response to influenza vaccination of psoriasis patients treated with ustekinumab with that of patients who are not receiving this treatment. We will assess gene expression profiles and white blood cell subsets in the blood of psoriasis patients before vaccination and at multiple time-points after vaccination.

Whereas these studies focused on memory development, the impact of low-dose Rapa on the primary immune response, particularly as it relates to functional effector immunity, is far less clear. In this study, we investigated the impact of acute Rapa treatment on immune effector cell function during the primary immune response to several acute infections. We found that functional CD8 T cell and macrophage responses to both viral and intracellular bacterial pathogens were depressed in mice in vivo and in humans to phorbol ester and calcium ionophore stimulation in vitro in the face of low-dose Rapa treatment. Mechanistically, the CD8 defect was linked to impaired glycolytic switch in stimulated naive cells and the reduced formation of short-lived effector cells. Therefore, more than one cell type required for a protective effector immune response is impaired by Rapa in both mice and humans, at the dose shown to improve immune memory and extend lifespan. This urges caution with regard to the relative therapeutic costs and benefits of Rapa treatment as means to improve immune memory.			0.25	SDY653	Immunological basis of age-related vulnerability in biodefense and emerging infections SP2 UAz	Janko Nikolich-Zugich: University of Arizona;Emily Goldberg: University of Arizona	Mus musculus	DR15	lymphocytic choriomeningitis;West Nile fever;Listeria meningitis	N		Months	Other;Flow Cytometry	0.17	10.21430/M3IY2GJYV6

Although the importance of CD4 T cells in control of tuberculosis is well-established, the importance of CD8+ lymphocytes is less clear. Here, we investigated the requirement for all CD8+ lymphocytes (innate and adaptive) or just CD8 alpha/beta adaptive T cells in control of initial and early infection in cynomolgus macaques, using anti-CD8alpha or anti-CD8beta depleting antibodies in vivo. Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of lung granulomas from control (undepleted) macaques at 6 weeks post-infection revealed a rich landscape of cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. Anti-CD8alpha antibody resulted in susbstantial loss of all CD8+ lymphocytes from granulomas, while anti-CD8beta antibody selectively depleted classical CD8alpha beta T cells. In CD8-depleted granulomas, CD4 T cells and gamma delta T cells had increased expression of certain cytotoxic effectors, such as granzymes. However, these cells had reduced expression of perforin, granulysin, and/or CCL5, and thus displayed an incomplete cytotoxic profile. At 6 weeks post-infection, CD8 alpha depleted macaques had increased granuloma numbers, lung inflammation, and total thoracic bacterial burden, while CD8beta-depleted macaques showed increased lymph node bacterial burden. Mtb barcode analysis revealed that depletion of all CD8+ lymphocytes resulted in greater initial establishment of Mtb in the lungs, indicating a loosening of the airway bottleneck for infection, and increased dissemination of Mtb within lungs, to lymph nodes and to extrapulmonary sites. These data suggest that the total CD8+ lymphocyte population is critical for early control of Mtb infection in macaques and support the importance of targeting CD8+ lymphocytes in a vaccine strategy.

Mucosal T cell responses play an important role in mediating H. pylori-related gastric immunopathology. While induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells are required for chronic colonization without disease, Th1 effector responses are associated with lower bacterial load at the expense of gastric pathology. With the objective of developing a large animal model of H. pylori infection, pigs were inoculated with either H. pylori strain SS1 or J99. Changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations were monitored weekly, and mucosal immune responses and bacterial loads were assessed at day 57 post-infection. Both H. pylori strains elicited a Th1 response with increased percentage of CD4+Tbet+ cells and elevated Tbet and IFN-. mRNA in PBMC. A subset of CD8beta+ T cells and B cells expressing Tbet increased due to infection. Moreover, a significant increase of NK cells was observed in infected pigs pointing towards a predominant cytotoxic immune response. Infiltration of cytotoxic cells was detected in the gastric lamina propria of both infected groups. Interestingly, strain J99 evoked a more dramatic acute response associated with lower bacterial loads, while strain SS1 showed longer-term colonization capacity. This novel pig model of infection closely mimics human gastric pathology and presents a suitable avenue for studying the cytotoxic and regulatory responses towards H. pylori described in humans.

We isolated BrmIgA from de-identified donors and use flow cytometry to characterize the intensity of antibacterial reactivity. Our results show heterogeneity of inter-donor BrmIgA reactivity but intra-donor stability over time. In addition, there was no significant difference in IgA concentration or reactivity between preterm and term donor milk. Lastly, we found that holder pasteurization globally reduces BrmIgA reactivity.

As a surrogate, we believe investigating the immune response to varicella vaccination will yield important information about alterations in the immune response to live virus vaccines subjects with AD. Evaluation of 30 analyzable children with AD and 30 analyzable nonatopic controls is planned. Subjects immunized with varicella vaccine will have blood drawn for laboratory evaluations 3 weeks after immunization. The immune response to varicella will be assessed by measuring the proportion of varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific T cells, perforin production, and VZV-specific antibody titers. Because of the and systemic T helper cell 2 (Th2) polarization of subjects with AD, an altered response to varicella vaccination expected. Specifically, it is expected that AD subjects will exhibit decreased cell-mediated responses, but exhibit normal to increased humoral responses as evidenced by production of VZV-specific antibodies.

The mechanisms of action modulating the plasticity between Th17 and Treg cells are incompletely understood. To gain a better understanding of the differentiation process we have constructed a computational model in COPASI that mimics CD4+ T cell differentiation and contemplates the plasticity between effector Th17 and Treg. Our computer simulations predicted that activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg) induces a switch from already differentiated Th17 into Treg. Experimental validation approaches support this in silico prediction. The conclusion of this project is that PPARg promotes differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Treg, downregulates Th17 differentiation and favors phenotype switch from Th17 into Treg cells.

However, identifying associations between features and outputs can be beset by spurious connections due to indirect impacts propagating through an unmapped biological network. We applied a probabilistic graphical modeling approach, Markov Fields, to dissect correlations between immune features in a public multi-modal dataset (systems serology, cytokines, cytometry) of macaques undergoing intravenous BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. This yielded an interaction network that interprets network paths underlying vaccine efficacy, and shows how correlations between features often arise indirectly. We next conducted experimental depletion of B cells during vaccination in macaques—which did not reduce protection against tuberculosis—to validate our Markov Field model’s predictions of network-wide shifts post-depletion. Finally, we highlight immune changes predicted to strongly affect intravenous BCG vaccine efficacy, showing that probabilistic graphical models increase the interpretability of multi-modal datasets for identifying new disease targets.

Here, we advance the utility of this unique mouse resource for immunology research, as it allows for both examination and genetic dissection of mechanisms behind adaptive immune states in mice with distinct and defined genetic makeups. This approach is founded on quantitative trait locus mapping: identifying genetically variant genome regions associated with phenotypic variance in traits-of-interest. Furthermore, the CC can be utilized for mouse model development; distinct strains have unique immunophenotypes and immune properties, making them suitable for research on particular diseases and infections. Here, we describe variation in cellular immune phenotypes across F1 crosses of CC strains, and reveal novel quantitative trait loci responsible for several immune phenotypes.

Mice intranasally challenged with Alternaria alternata, a fungal allergen associated with severe asthma and fatal exacerbations in humans, potently activates ILC2s via the IL-33/ST2 (IL-33R) axis to robustly secrete type 2 cytokines. Animal models, including Alternaria-induced lung inflammation in mice, have given us critical insight into pathways of ILC2 regulation that appear to apply to ILC2 responses in human disease.7 Thus, accurate identification of ILC2s in the lungs of mice is critical to future understanding of their biology and contribution to allergic disease. We assessed whether the conventional ILC2 identification markers ST2 and CD127.

Specific age-related defects in T cell responses against dominant WNV epitopes were detected at the level of cytokine and lytic granule production, each of which are essential for resistance against WNV, and in the ability to generate multifunctional anti-WNV effector T cells, which are believed to be critical for robust antiviral immunity. In contrast, at the peak of the response, old and adult T cells exhibited superimposable peptide sensitivity. Most importantly, although the adult CD4 or CD8 T cells readily protected immunodeficient mice upon adoptive transfer, old T cells of either subset were unable to provide WNV-specific protection. Consistent with a profound qualitative and quantitative defect in T cell immunity, old brains contained at least 12x fewer total effector CD8 T cells compared with adult mice at the peak of brain infection. These findings identify potential targets for immunomodulation and treatment to combat lethal WNV infection in the elderly				SDY363	Immunological basis of age-related vulnerability in biodefense and emerging infections SP2 UAz	Janko Nikolich-Zugich: University of Arizona		DR12	West Nile fever;Aging	N		Months	ELISA;Other;Flow Cytometry		10.21430/M3ESFSL9VA

The study will be conducted as a randomized double blinded trial. Vaccine administration will be performed by an unblinded vaccine administrator, who will not be involved in subsequent assessments. Blood samples will be collected on Days D0 (at enrollment) and D3, D7, D14, D30 and D180 post vaccination to study innate and adaptive immunity markers. Even though meningococcal vaccination is considered safe, volunteers are asked to report any local or systemic AEs for 30 days post vaccination and any SAEs for 180 days post vaccination.

Here, we investigated T cells in mucosal sites, lymphoid tissues, and blood from 96 pediatric donors aged 0-10 years using phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic profiling. Our results revealed that memory T cells preferentially localized in the intestines and lungs during infancy and accumulated more rapidly in mucosal sites compared with blood and lymphoid organs, consistent with site-specific antigen exposure. Early life mucosal memory T cells exhibit distinct functional capacities and stem-like transcriptional profiles. In later childhood, they progressively adopt proinflammatory functions and tissue-resident signatures, coincident with increased T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion in mucosal and lymphoid sites. Together, our findings identify staged development of memory T cells targeted to tissues during the formative years, informing how we might promote and monitor immunity in children.
