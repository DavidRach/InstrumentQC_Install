We are now ready to discuss how the dashboard elements are coded and assemble to produce the individual webpages.\nFor our overall dashboard layout, the home/summary page is specified by the code contained within the index.qmd file. It’s main purpose is to serve as a landing page that rapidly loads in (since it doesn’t have any interactive elements).\nThen, each instrument has its own interactive webpage for exploring its data (taking longer to load as the data exploration is fully interactive). Each instruments webpage is specified by code contained within the individual instrument .qmd files (Aurora3L.qmd, Aurora4L.qmd, Aurora5L.qmd, AuroraCS.qmd). These share similar code layouts, but mainly differ in that 1) the file paths reference different archive data folders corresponding to their respective instruments; and 2) given each instrument has different laser-configurations, those with UV and Yellow-Green Lasers will have more plot elements than the others.\nFor this walk-though, we will be examining the the Aurora5L.qmd file from the original repository."

From there it removes those that show Gain as they will be plotted along with RCV separately. Once this is done, it filters the column names by presence of string characters in their names to separate the list of colnames into shorter list based on laser, scatter, etc.\nAt this point, each of the above element is simply smaller list of column names, that will then be plotted and visualized together. This happens in the portion of the larger code chunk shown below, with the smaller list being provided to the MeasurementType arguments.\n\nUltraVioletPlotsMFI &lt;- QC_Plots(x=x, FailedFlag=TRUE, MeasurementType=UltraVioletGains,\n                      plotType = \"comparison\", returntype = \"plots\",\n                      Metadata=\"Timepoint\", strict = TRUE, YAxisLabel = \"MFI\",\n                      RepairVisits=Repair5L)\n\nVioletPlotsMFI &lt;- QC_Plots(x=x, FailedFlag=TRUE, MeasurementType=VioletGains,\n                      plotType = \"comparison\", returntype = \"plots\",\n                      Metadata=\"Timepoint\", strict = TRUE, YAxisLabel = \"MFI\",\n                      RepairVisits=Repair5L)\n\nBluePlotsMFI &lt;- QC_Plots(x=x, FailedFlag=TRUE, MeasurementType=BlueGains,\n                      plotType = \"comparison\", returntype = \"plots\",\n                      Metadata=\"Timepoint\", strict = TRUE, YAxisLabel = \"MFI\",\n                      RepairVisits=Repair5L)\n\nYellowGreenPlotsMFI &lt;- QC_Plots(x=x, FailedFlag=TRUE, MeasurementType=YellowGreenGains,\n                      plotType = \"comparison\", returntype = \"plots\",\n                      Metadata=\"Timepoint\", strict = TRUE, YAxisLabel = \"MFI\",\n                      RepairVisits=Repair5L)\n\nRedPlotsMFI &lt;- QC_Plots(x=x, FailedFlag=TRUE, MeasurementType=RedGains,\n                     plotType = \"comparison\", returntype = \"plots\",\n                     Metadata=\"Timepoint\", strict = TRUE, YAxisLabel = \"MFI\",\n                     RepairVisits=Repair5L)\n\nScatterPlotsMFI &lt;- QC_Plots(x=x, FailedFlag=TRUE, MeasurementType=ScatterGains,\n                     plotType = \"comparison\", returntype = \"plots\",\n                     Metadata=\"Timepoint\", strict = TRUE, YAxisLabel = \" \",\n                     RepairVisits=Repair5L)\n\nLaserPlotsMFI &lt;- QC_Plots(x=x, FailedFlag=TRUE, MeasurementType=LaserGains,\n                     plotType = \"comparison\", returntype = \"plots\",\n                     Metadata=\"Timepoint\", strict = TRUE, YAxisLabel = \" \",\n                     RepairVisits=Repair5L)\n\nOnce this is done, each of the elements above contains a list of plots corresponding to the column names that were provided in the smaller list. These will be referenced later when building the dashboard in the desired layout.\nThis process is then repeated again in two large code chunks for both Gain and RCV, with some small differences in how the column names are separated into smaller list, and how the individual ggplots are generated.\nStarting on line 205 of Aurora5L.qmd we have the following code-chunk:\n\nPDFPlots &lt;- c(UltraVioletPlotsMFI, VioletPlotsMFI, BluePlotsMFI, YellowGreenPlotsMFI, RedPlotsMFI, LaserPlotsMFI, ScatterPlotsMFI, UltraVioletPlotsGain, VioletPlotsGain, BluePlotsGain, YellowGreenPlotsGain, RedPlotsGain, ScatterPlotsGain, LaserDelayPlotsGain, LaserPowerPlotsGain,  ScalingPlotsGain, UltraVioletPlotsRCV, VioletPlotsRCV, BluePlotsRCV, YellowGreenPlotsRCV, RedPlotsRCV, ScatterPlotsRCV)\n\nFilename &lt;- paste0(\"QCPlots_5L\")\n\nPDF &lt;- Utility_Patchwork(x=PDFPlots, filename=Filename, returntype=\"pdf\", outfolder=MainFolder, thecolumns=1)\n\nThis code chunk above assembled all the plots we generated in the section above, and saves them as the .pdf for the individual instrument that can be seen under the data tab of the dashboard website."

Consequently, on line 218 you will see the following “## MFI {.tabset}”. The two # designate the first column.

Then Scatter, LaserPower, LaserDelay, LaserScatter plots are visualized in their respective tabs.\nFinally, marking the end of the first column we find a card element “{.card title=”MFI”}” that appears within the tabset at the end but contains no plots to serve as a reference of what the first column plots are showing.\n\n\nGain and rCV\nAbove we walked through the process of displaying the MFI plots generated in the first section within tabsets for individual lasers. At line 345, we encounter “## Gain {.tabset}” which designates the second column of the dashboard, containing tabs for the Gain plots by laser. The overall layout is similar to what we encountered, differing here and there based on additional plots present within it’s respective archive .csv but not found in the bead csv MFI derrived from.\nAfter all the Gain plots are plotted, we encounter the third column “## RCV {.tabset}” at line 472, continuing until the end."

This website is for those who would like to understand how it is implemented, either for curiosity or because you’d like to modify the code to visualize the instrument QC data for your own Cytek instruments at your current workplace.\nHaving placed significant effort into this pet-project, I would love for others in the cytometry community to benefit from it. Setting it up from scratch requires some familiarity with both R and Git, so to give the average cytometry aficionado a fighting-chance I am providing this detailed explanation of the process of setting up and customizing the dashboard.\nIf you get stuck, or parts of the documentation are unclear, please reach out by opening an issue and I will try my best to help you troubleshoot. what makes free-and-open source software great (and fun to work with in my opinion) is seeing how the collective small contributions of users improve the project over time.\nBest- David\n\n\nOverview\nAfter daily QC is run on a Cytek instrument, the relevant information is stored as .fcs and .csv files in specific folders. Using functions incorporated in the Luciernaga R package, the data associated with these newly generated files is processed using R once a day at a user-designated time (implemented via Windows Task Sceduler). The version control software Git keeps track of changes to the processed data, passing updates to the online GitHub repository for storage. This data is then referenced when building the dashboard website using Quarto, which is published as a GitHub page allowing for url access.\nFor multiple instruments, the above process is repeated on each instruments computer, and the Quarto webpages are modified to display data from each instrument."

Below this level, there is a data folder containing folders for the individual instruments. Below this level, are folders containing the archive data folders where processed data is stored after processing and updated with new data daily.\nOn first install, modify the names of the folders for your individual instruments, and navigate into the archive folders for the renamed instruments and delete the forked version of the data. These archive data files will be replaced by those of your own instrument after the initial processing.\nNext, you will need to modify the existing Rscript to match the following names, and to point at the Cytekbio Setup folder containing the DailyQC files and to the folder containing the bead .fcs files used as part of the MFI monitoring. Make sure these are correct.\nNow, on the upper right hand side, hit the Source option. This should trigger the processing of the entire R script needed to process the past data.

    "title": "Manual Transfer",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Once the file.paths to find the instruments archive data are found, and the individual instrument R script and .qmd file are updated to reflect these, it is possible to start rendering the individual instrument webpage on the local computer. But when you have multiple instruments contributing data to the dashboard home page and individual instrument pages, we need a way to ensure the data from each instrument gets transferred to GitHub to allow Quarto to render the update version. This can be done either manually, or in an automated fashion. We will explore both options\n\nManual Transfer\nWe will first navigate to the InstrumentQC folder and locate the Examples_staff.qmd file. We will duplicate it, creating a new copy that will simply be called staff.qmd. This name is set within the .gitignore file to be ignored, allowing local copies with different file paths to be present on each instrument computer without causing issues in the version control.\nOnce we open the duplicated and renamed staff.qmd file, we find a single code chunk with several lines of code. This code chunk is meant to be executed by staff after morning QC has been carried out on the instrument by clicking the green play button showing “Run Current Chunk” on the upper-left side of the code-block. Once this is done, it will run the code, find the file.path to the .R script for that individual instrument, and run it. In the process, it executes the pull from the GitHub repository, processes the new data, and then pushes the updated data to the GitHub repository.\nOnce the source command has finished executing, the option is present to introduce a Flag.csv file. This will prevent automated transfer if set-up from occuring later that day (more below).\nManual sending the data has advantages as you are already at the instrument during the Instrument QC process, and the extra minute to run the current code-chunk shouldn’t add that much extra inconvenience. The drawbacks occur in that if you or others are not comfortable with Rstudio, you need to interact with it, and not forget to send the data before an user gets on the instrument.\n\n\nAutomating Transfer\nThe second option is to set up an automated transfer of the QC data from each instrument to the GitHub repository. This is possible by using the Windows Task Scheduler, which is the same system that schedules when your computer updates run, etc. The time at which the automated transfer is carried out can be designated by the user, and setup is carried out through use of the R package taskscheduleR.\nIn context of our institution, QC on all instruments is generally done by 10:30 AM. Consequently, we scedule automated transfer of the QC data to begin at 10:30 AM. When it works, we get all the data transferred from all instruments without any extra effort at the designated time daily, making updating of the dashboard simple.\nUnfortunately, task scheduler opens a black terminal window pop up when it is actively running. This doesn’t affect anything on the cytometer acquisition, but it can startle anyone who doesn’t expect it. In our experience, when an user is on the instrument at the time, they will either panic and immediately close the black terminal window, or after not closing for 10 seconds get annoyed and close it down. At which point, no data will be automatically transferred to the GitHub repository for that day barring manual staff intervention. Emails to users and warning note on insturment computer help reduce the occasions this above scenario occurs, but user community awareness and buy in is still required. Alternately, schedule during non-operation hours, and have the dashboard data be delayed from real time.\nTo begin, we will open the TaskSchedules.qmd file within InstrumentQC. You will first call library for the TaskScheduleR package. Then you will verify the file.path to the instrument R script is correctly updated. You will then modify the first chunk of code to desired task schedule name, and set the time. Then run that code chunk. Finally check using the command to verify the task. If you want to remove a scheduled task, run the third set commands including the previous task schedule name and if confirmation received, the previously scheduled task is now removed.\n\n\nHybrid\nIn our setting, we have automated QC set to run at 10:30, staggered by two minutes for each instruments to avoid discrepancy issues of version control when the scripts push pull data from the github repository. We also have a staff.qmd file so that manual sending of the data can occur if SRL finish QC early or an user-shutdown occurs. To avoid having both things happen, the staff.qmd file generates a Flag.csv after manual completion. Within the individual R script, the first condition checks for presence of this file, and if found doesn’t proceed with automated QC for the designated time.\nWe then set another Task Schedule for later that same day to remove the Flag.csv file, allowing a reset of the process so that automated QC can proceed the next morning. To do this, we would go into Examples_Flag.qmd and copy the example into a new .R file we call FlagRemoval.R (also covered by the .gitignore file to avoid filepath conflicts across instruments). We then add a new taskschedule to run this R script later in the afternoon.\nFinally, in attempt to reduce the time spent by the automated processing of the data during the morning being interrupted by the user, we set a TaskSchedule to pull from the GitHub repository at 6 AM, which brings in the updates from the other instruments and dashboard website, reducing the time the black terminal screen is open during the scheduled 10:30 round.\n\n\nRendering the Dashboard\nRegardless whether you implemtent the manual, automated or hybrid approach, you will end up with the updated QC data from each instrument present on the GitHub repository. These changes are tracked by git as part of version control. We previously discussed the individual instrument pages designated by their .qmd files, but we need to discuss the home/summary index.qmd page that combines all the data sources.\nBriefly, it shows the indicator blocks for the individual instruments (color-coded pass, caution, fail). The second column shows the results of the daily QC for the day (with tabsets for each instrument). And finally a six-month QC for all instruments is visible in the third column.\nAdditionally, the navbar and footer elements are specified within the _quarto.yaml file allowing for customization/rearranging/renaming as desired. In our dashboard there are additional tabs that reference Data to get the data as .csv or .pdf by the individual users, and a Help page for general information about the dashboard.\nTo assemble the dashboard with the updated data, one can either pull in the data to the local computer, and then render the project to assemble the website and individual dashboard pages into a single unit. All the changes to the files would then be committed, with the data passed to GitHub repository.\nOn the GitHub repository side, one would customize the repostitory to use GitHub pages, set to display contents of the docs folder (containing the rendered html pages). Upon pushing the updates, GitHub would then process them and display them as a website.\n\n\nFuture Directions - Github Actions\nRendering locally takes computer time and computer space. Additionally, it means each instrument needs to bring in edited versions of the website locally every morning with their initial pull. We are currently working to set up a GitHub actions that would ensure the website portion remains only within the GitHub repository (not rendered or copied locally to each instrument taking up additional memory) but additionally render at a given time reducing the requirement to manually render and push the updated dashboard. This occurs thanks to cloud access available to GitHub repositories that are public, with a certain ammount of free server time allocated to each.\nThe reason not currently available, is that it is more complicated technically and I am busy writing. But more broadly, the cloud instance needs to install R and R packages needed to run everything each and every time. And the Luciernaga package is still MB heavy due to it being in testing phase and having a lot of .fcs files in it’s extdata folder. Consequently, an area that has promise, but not yet implemented, stay tuned."

    "text": "Once your GitHub account is set up, it’s time to use it. Our core’s version of the dashboard is contained within the InstrumentQC repository. This is publicly available, and since the software repository is licensed under a free copyleft license, you are able to fork (ie. copy) the existing project and modify it.\nTo do so, you will first navigate to the InstrumentQC repository. From here you will select the fork the repository option\n\n\n\n\n\nGitHub will then give you the option to rename the project or to keep the existing name. If you modify the name, there may be a couple additional lines of code you will need to also adjust in the future, but this will be minor enough of a concern so don’t let that stop you if you hate the existing name.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that done, you now have your own copy of the repository. Since it is forked, you can now modify and customize the dashboard so that is customized to your instruments and tracks their QC data. Before proceeding, please make a note about your forked repositories url as you will need it later when when bringing in the project to the local computer environment with Rstudio in a little bit."

If it is your first time doing so, select the default R installation from the first pop-up window. Open up Rstudio for the first time, and set to use the default R installation.\nWe first need to make sure Rstudio can communicate with GitHub through Git. To do this we will first install the R package devtools. To do so, copy the following lines of code invidivually into the console window and hit enter to run the commands:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n\nlibrary(devtools)\nlibrary(BiocManager)\n\nFor coding-beginners, please note, if any errors pop up during the installation of devtools, read the red troubleshooting explanations shown, and install any missing package dependencies by swapping in the package name between the quotation marks similar to what was done in the code chunk above to install the devtools package.\nOnce devtools is installed, and you have called it via library, we can now continue.\nAdjacent to your console tab on the lower left, there is another tab called terminal. Go ahead and click it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have switched from the console to the terminal, copy-paste using your mouse/right-click the following lines of code individually, editing in your GitHub UserName, and email linked to your GitHub account:\n\ngit config --global user.email \"JohnDoe@gmail.com\"\n\ngit config --global user.name \"John Doe\""

Go ahead and place a note for the token with the instrument name so you know which match with each other. Set the expiration for no expiration or a long-period, and only click on the repo option to grant those accesses. Proceed down to the bottom of the screen and click on the green generate token button.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe website will refresh and provide you a GitHub token and the option to copy it. Copy it and temporarily store it in a .txt file (notepad) as you will need it when setting up the connection between Github and Rstudio. You will not be able to see the code again from this screen, so stash wisely, and be cautious not to store this anywhere that others may find it."
